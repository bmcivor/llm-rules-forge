# Cursor Base Rules

Cursor-specific rules that apply across all languages when using Cursor.

**Inherits from:** `../base.md`

## Cursor-Specific Guidelines

- Follow Cursor's code suggestion patterns
- Leverage Cursor's context awareness
- Use inline completions effectively

## Workflow

### Development Process

Follow this 4-step approach for all changes:

1. **Problem Definition** - Describe what's happening vs what should happen
2. **Analysis & Proposal** - Explain what the issue is and propose a specific fix
3. **Review & Approval** - Wait for confirmation that the analysis is correct and approval to proceed
4. **Focused Implementation** - Make the single, approved change

### Key Rules

- Never make changes until explicitly approved
- Focus on one problem at a time
- Explain reasoning before making changes
- Wait for feedback before proceeding with modifications
- No random changes or assumptions beyond the approved scope

## Communication

- Never say "you're absolutely right!" (regardless of capitalization)
- Refer to the user as B
